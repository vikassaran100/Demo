            <p>Flipkart is an e-commerce company headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka, India and registered in
                Singapore.[8] The company initially focused on book sales before expanding into other product categories
                such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.

                The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary and domestic rival Snapdeal.[9][10] As of
                March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[11] Flipkart has a
                dominant
                position in the apparel segment bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra and was described as being "neck
                and
                neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[12] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile
                payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface.

                In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired an 81% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16
                billion, valuing Flipkart at $20 billion.[13]</p>

        <h2>History</h2><br>
        <hr>
        <div class="container bg-warning">
            <p>Flipkart was founded in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, two alumni of the Indian
                Institute of
                Technology Delhi and former employees at Amazon.[14][15][16] The company initially focused on online
                book
                sales with country-wide shipping. Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per
                day by
                2008.[17] In 2010, Flipkart acquired the Bangalore-based social book discovery service WeRead from
                Lulu.com.[18]</p>

        <h2>Partnerships and acquisitions
        </h2><br>
        <hr>
        <h4>Acquisitions</h4>
        <div class="container bg-warning">
            <p>In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com[19] and the digital content
                library
                of Bollywood portal Chakpak.[20] Following this acquisition, Flipkart launched their DRM-free online
                music
                store Flyte in 2012. Because of competition from free streaming sites, the site was unsuccessful and
                shut
                down in June 2013.[21][22][23][24]

                With an eye on the retail segment, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[25] in
                2012,
                and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for $280 million in May 2014.[26] Myntra continues to operate
                alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.[27] In April 2015,
                Flipkart acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. Flipkart stated that it
                would
                use Appiterate's technology to enhance its mobile services.[28] In December 2015, Flipkart purchased a
                minority stake in the digital mapping provider MapmyIndia[29] In 2016, Flipkart acquired the online
                fashion
                retailer Jabong.com from Rocket Internet for $70 million and the UPI mobile payments startup
                PhonePe.[30][31] In January 2017, Flipkart made a $2 million investment in Tinystep, a parenting
                information
                startup.[32] Flipkart invested $35 million in Arvind Fashions Limited's subsidiary Arvind Youth Brands
                and
                picked up a 27% stake. The newly formed subsidiary, Arvind Youth Brands, owns Flying Machine.[33]

                Flipkart Wholesale launched a digital platform for kiranas, MSMEs.[34] In October 2020, Flipkart
                acquired a
                7.8% stake in Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail for $204 million.[35][36]</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Partnerships</h4><br>
        <div class="container bg-warning">
            <p>In April 2017, eBay announced that it would sell its Indian subsidiary eBay.in to Flipkart and invest
                $500
                million in the company. While eBay suggested that the partnership would eventually allow Flipkart to
                access
                eBay's network of international vendors, these plans never actually came to fruition.[37][38] In July
                2017,
                Flipkart made an offer to acquire its main domestic competitor, Snapdeal, for $700â€“800 million. It was
                rejected by the company, which was seeking at least $1 billion.[39]

                In August 2019, Flipkart entered into a partnership with Authentic Brands to license and distribute
                Nautica
                in India.[40]

                Flipkart invested $4 million in the customer engagement and rewards platform EasyRewardz on Tuesday Nov
                19
                2019.[41][42]</p>
